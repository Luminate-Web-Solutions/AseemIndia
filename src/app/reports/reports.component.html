          <p>
            Muslim Community in India lags behind in all development indicators and in many aspects is more backward than the dalits. The Sachar Committee has pointed this out very clearly.
          </p>
          <p>According to its report:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Only 17% children in the community complete matriculation</li>
            <li>Only 8% Muslims in urban areas are employed in the organized sector</li>
            <li>Only 46% of the total loans given by banks go to the Muslim Community</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>ASEEM Report 2016-2017</h3>
          <p>
            Marginalised communities are not integrated into the nation's mainstream despite the many schemes and benefits that the government has to offer because very often well meaning philanthropy from within the community creates a content unproductive recipient community that is dependent on hand-outs and alienated from the mainstream. A small group of like-minded people came forward to create awareness of and access to government schemes and benefits among the marginalised communities. Syed Naqi M.Sc and Al-Asghar arrived with considerable experience of having worked with artisans and workers for two decades spearheaded this intervention. Their logic was simple and clear: the government has funds and it has a constitutional obligation towards its citizens.

          <h3>ASEEM Report 2015-2021</h3>
          <p>
            From 2015-2021 we focused on enabling poor Muslims in Hyderabad to access government programmes and funds. We hand held them through the entire process of preparing applications, opening bank accounts, filing applications and follow up till they start receiving funds in their bank accounts. In order to scale up community impact we strategically shifted focus in 2016 from service delivery to facilitating and training Grass Roots Organizations in accessing government programmes and funds while we actively engaged in advocacy and social audit (research) of government programmes meant for minority community for better and timely implementation.
