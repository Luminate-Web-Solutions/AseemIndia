          ASEEM collaborated with like minded institutions like CWS, HMI to develop a 10 module course which exposes its trainees to different movements and development initiatives apart from imparting skills to trigger and sustain initiatives and movements in their own communities.

        <h3>Action Research and Social Audit</h3>
        <p>
          We undertake Social Audit of different development programmes of the government to document its components, structure, processes and procedures, implementation at various levels - successes, bottlenecks, outreach and impact. At the community level, LEAD participants are involved to study the outreach, impact and bottlenecks at the grass roots implementation level.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reports generated through this process are used to generate awareness amongst the civil society organisations about the implementation of the programme and thus involve them in advocacy interventions for effective implementation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently we are engaged in Social Audit of the Telangana State Minority Welfare Department.
