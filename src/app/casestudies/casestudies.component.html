              <p>Mir Karaar Ali voice expresses a blend of happiness and regret as he narrates how our timely intervention enabled him to get a scholarship for his daughter Syeda Mehjabeen Fatima, studying in Grade 7, Fountainhead School. He is grateful that our staff contacted him and explained the process of application for scholarship as well as facilitated the process for him. He found it difficult to educate all his children- a son and two daughters but this scholarship ensured that the financial burden of educating one of his daughters is lifted from his shoulders. He plans to apply for the second daughter's scholarship with our help. His regret is that if he had known of this scheme and of us, his older son would not have had to discontinue school and take up a job.</p>

              <p>Mairam Begum, 30 years old, is emotional as she speaks of losing her husband to an accident four years ago. Left to fend for herself and her four daughters, she struggles to make ends meet by tailoring. Our staff got to know of her plight and enlightened her that she is eligible for the Widow's Pension. They helped her to file the application last year and she has been receiving pension for the past six months. She says with a sigh of relief that this pension eases her financial difficulty to some extent. She testifies that her experience with us is good and has applied for her older daughter Zeenath Begum's scholarship through us a fortnight ago. We advised her to apply for scholarships for all her children.</p>

              <p>Saba Fatima has two children- Samreen Begum and Mir Hussain Ali, studying in IZM School, Yakutpura. We held a scholarship awareness camp in IZM last year and Saba Fatima is one of the many parents who got to know about this scheme through us. As her husband works in a bakery, their financial constraints nearly made her decide to withdraw her children from school. But thanks to the awareness camp, she got to know in the nick of time and we helped her to file a scholarship application for her daughter. Now that this application has proven to be successful, she wants to apply for her son.</p>

              <p>Fatima Bee, 70 years old, is one of those genial grandmothers with a ready smile despite all the difficulties that life has thrown her way. She was widowed six years ago. She doesn't have any savings to speak of as her husband was a daily wage worker and she used to work as domestic help. She says that she used to work the whole day and earn Rs. 600/- per month. Fatima Bee is asthmatic and also suffers from the usual complaints of diabetes and hypertension. She says with a beaming smile that thanks to her availing of the pension scheme through our service, she no longer has to depend on anyone for her medicine.</p>
