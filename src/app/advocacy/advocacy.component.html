          Advocacy is one of the key areas of ASEEM. We advocate for the rights and entitlements of the marginalized communities by engaging with the government officials and elected representatives. We make them aware of the community needs and challenges and urge them to take appropriate actions.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also suggest ways to streamline the scheme criteria and procedures and simplify the scheme application process to make them more accessible and user-friendly for the marginalized people. We periodically generate reports based on our research and field observations and share them with the relevant authorities and stakeholders.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also organize consultations with different actors, such as civil society organizations, media, academics, and experts, to discuss the issues and solutions related to the marginalized communities.

      We use legal interventions to complement our advocacy efforts and to seek justice for the marginalized communities. We file public interest litigations (PILs) in the courts to address the issues that affect the marginalized people and to challenge the policies and actions that violate their rights and entitlements.
    </p>
    <p class="text-center mb-5">
      PILs are a powerful tool for social change and for upholding the rule of law and ensuring the balance between law and justice.
