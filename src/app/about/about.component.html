      There are numerous Muslim Charities which provide relief, succour and support to millions of poor from within the
      community. Their rationale is that philanthropy and charity are central tenets of Islam. However, a closer
      inspection reveals that often well meaning philanthropy has created a community that is dependent on hand-outs
      and alienated it from the mainstream. Thus, the movement from charity towards development and empowerment
      which transforms beneficiaries into stakeholders in the process of development seems to have completely
      bypassed the community. This becomes a major reason why the community seldom accesses government
      development programmes resulting in movement away from the national mainstream.

    <p class="text-center mb-4">
      Muslim Community in India lags behind in all development indicators and in many aspects is more
      backward than the dalits. The Sachar Committee has pointed this out very starkly. According to its

          <h3>Restricted Access to Government Programs</h3>
          <p>
            Complex processes and procedures severely restrict the community's access to government programmes and
            schemes. This results in severe under-utilization of budgets allocated for development of Minority
            Communities.

          <h3>Limited Banking Services for Muslim Entrepreneurs and Artisans</h3>
          <p>
            Most Muslim are either micro entrepreneurs or artisans. Their access to banking services is severely
            restricted resulting in exploitation by unorganized money lenders from whom they borrow to meet their
            working capital needs.

          <h3>Dependence on Charity Hindering Community Development</h3>
          <p>
            Being perennially dependent on doles and charity, the community's growth is stunted. Dependence on
            charitable programs is a relationship. Therefore the real issues of the community do not find adequate
            representation in the government and other policy formulation platforms.

          ASEEM works with volunteers engaged with grass-root organizations in the Muslim Community. These volunteers to be leaders/workers dedicated to trigger movements within the community towards accessing their constitutional rights to social and economic development. We realize that the impact of this kind of an intervention will be limited if it remains only a time-sustained and mere-governmental effort and visualize the community and make them productive citizens.
