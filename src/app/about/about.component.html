      <p>
        There are numerous Muslim charities that provide relief, succor, and
        support to millions of poor from within the community. However, a closer
        inspection reveals that their philanthropy creates a dependency that
        keeps the community distanced from the mainstream.

          <h4>Restricted Access to Government Programs</h4>
          <p>
            Complex procedures severely restrict the communityâ€™s access to

            budgets.

          <h4>Limited Banking Services</h4>
          <p>
            Most Muslims are micro-entrepreneurs or artisans, facing limited
            access to banking services, leading to financial exploitation.
